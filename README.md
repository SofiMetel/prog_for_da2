## An analysis of paleo-present climate data

## Requirements:

• Analyse CO2 vs Temperature Anomaly from 800kyrs – present.

• Examine one other (paleo/modern) features (e.g. CH4 or polar ice-coverage)

• Examine Irish context:
o Climate change signals: (see Maynooth study: The emergence of a climate change signal in long-term Irish meteorological observations - ScienceDirect) [link:https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212094723000610#bib13 ]

• Fuse and analyse data from various data sources and format fused data set as a pandas dataframe and export to csv and json formats

• For all of the above variables, analyse the data, the trends and the relationships between them (temporal leads/lags/frequency analysis).

• Predict global temperature anomaly over next few decades (synthesise data) and compare to published climate models if atmospheric CO2 trends continue

• Comment on accelerated warming based on very latest features (e.g. temperature/polar-icecoverage)

Use a Jupyter notebook for your analysis and track your progress using GitHub.

## Instructions:

### Jupyter Notebook:
- Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
- Install Jupyter Notebook using `pip install jupyter` if not already installed.
- Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
- Open a terminal and navigate to the project's root directory.
- Run jupyter notebook to launch the Jupyter Notebook server.
- Access the project.ipynb file and execute each cell sequentially to explore the analyses.

### Datasets:
The `datasets` folder contains all the necessary datasets used in the project.
Ensure the datasets are accessible to the Jupyter Notebook.
If required, update the file paths in the notebook accordingly.

`project.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analyses.

`datasets/`: Folder containing the relevant datasets

`fused_datasets/`: Contain fused dataset of CH4, CO2, temperature anomalies for 800kyr-present
